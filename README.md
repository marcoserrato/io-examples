# io-examples

A repo for gathering simple examples of io programs

## Setup

Getting Io running locally was a bit of a headache, but I got
it working by building it myself using the following the build instructions
here: https://github.com/IoLanguage/io#linux-build-instructions

Note: if you're building this on an M1 Mac, I had build it
by running a terminal using Rosetta.

You can do that by right-clicking terminal.app -> Get Info -> Check the `Open using Rosetta` box
